## Project Overview

This application enables individual users to:

- Log daily expenses with category and date.
- Set category-wise monthly budgets.
- Automatically track spending against budgets.
- View monthly summary reports.
- Handle common edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, budget breaches).
- Focus on backend logic using Python and Flask (minimal front-end).

## Evaluation Notes

- This is a public GitHub repository as required by the L7 Informatics assignment.
- Evaluators can simply clone the repo and follow this README to run the app.
- Focus has been placed on backend functionality and edge case handling.
- Minimal time was spent on CSS and front-end design, as per instructions.
- All key features and validations are documented above for easy scoring.

## Demo Walkthrough

- Open the browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` after running the app.
- Use the registration page to create a user account.
- Login and begin adding expenses under different categories.
- Set a monthly budget under the ‚ÄúSet Monthly Budget‚Äù section.
- Add group expenses by creating a group and adding members, then log shared expenses to see automatic splitting.
- View all expenses and budgets in structured tables on the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements

- Add password encryption and secure session management.
- Introduce email notifications for low budget alerts.
- Add chart visualizations (e.g., pie and bar charts) for spending insights.
- Allow exporting data to CSV or PDF reports.
- Improve mobile responsiveness and styling.
